check:
shell script to run tests in multiple files
- You can run 1 test at a time
- In general, better with Codeforces contests (because you can combine with cfparser.py)

python script to run tests in a single file
- Easier to put custom tests
- Simpler/Folder less poluted (less files)
- In general, better with non-Codeforces contests (because it's simpler, once you don't have cfparser.py)
